Move a servo motor using an Xbox Joystick

Control two servo motors using an Xbox controller connected to a Raspberry Pi. The joysticks on the control manipulate the angles of the servo motors. The program translates the control readings into angles and sends them to an Arduino via serial communication. The Arduino then adjusts the servos to the provided angles, allowing remote control of their movement.
